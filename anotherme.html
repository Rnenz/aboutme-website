            In the realm of web development, I made significant contributions to our project. For HTML, I played a vital role in ensuring the integrity of our codebase by meticulously reviewing and assisting our group members with their coding efforts. Additionally, I was deeply involved in shaping the concept of our landing page, ensuring that it not only met our project objectives but also provided an engaging user experience. Furthermore, I offered crucial support in executing our experimental design.

            Regarding CSS, my contributions extended to gathering essential information to enhance our web page's aesthetics and functionality. I took the initiative to research and compile valuable details about the captivating tourist attractions that Macabebe has to offer, enriching our website's content. Moreover, I delved into the exploration of the local culinary scene, identifying a wide variety of delectable foods that would undoubtedly appeal to tourists visiting Macabebe. My dedication to both HTML and CSS played a pivotal role in achieving the success of our web project.
